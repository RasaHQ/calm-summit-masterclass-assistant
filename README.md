## Chat: Happy Path

**User**: I lost my wallet.

**Bot**: I am sorry this happened to you. First things first, we need to secure your accounts. Would you like me to lock all your cards temporarily while we figure things out?

**User**: Yes, let's go ahead and do that.

**Bot**: Understood. Your cards are now temporarily blocked to prevent any unauthorized transactions.

**Bot**: Would you like me to issue replacement cards?

**User**: Yes, I am not getting my wallet back.

**Bot**: I just need to make sure I have your address correct. Is this right?

**Bot**: 1 Embarcadero Center, San Francisco, CA

**User**: Yes, that's correct.

**Bot**: Great. I will send those cards there. Youâ€™ll receive them within 3 to 5 business days.

**Bot**: Is there anything else I can help you with?
